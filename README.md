# The Tesseract by Tustin

I created this mod menu many years ago for the PS3 version of GTA V. It used to be pay-for-use but was eventually cracked so I released it and maintained it for free. 
This has not been updated in almost 8 years and the code is so horrendous that it's borderline unusable. However, I spent a lot of time on this project and would like to see it archived.

There are many YouTube videos of this menu that you can find. I've also archived the original download site:

(This image was actually from a PC port I was working on, but I never finished it and I think the code is long gone)
